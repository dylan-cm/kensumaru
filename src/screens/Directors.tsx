        Everyone loves a treasure hunt story, everyone loves adventure, and
        everyone loves gold. The Kensu Maru project began when one of my friends
        in the treasure hunting world connected me with renowned treasure
        hunter, John Casey. John told me the story of Chuck McDougald, an
        octogenarian former Green Beret captain planning a final mission to the
        Philippines to recover billions in gold from a sunken WWII Japanese
        ship. I immediately saw it as a movie.
        <br />
        <br />

        I understand the lure of treasure hunting having worked on several
        treasure expeditions in Bermuda, the Caribbean, and Venezuela, where I
        co-discovered the French Fleet of 1678 in Islas Las Aves. There’s a
        certain adrenaline rush that comes with touching history for the first
        time, for imagining the circumstances, for feeling what it must have
        been like for those involved in a violent tragedy at sea, and finding
        what they left behind.
        <br />
        <br />
        But there was something else that interested me in The Kensu Maru
        Expedition. It’s more than just a treasure hunt. It’s a philanthropic
        endeavor. It’s a way to fund and support humanitarian and environmental
        programs not only in the Philippines, but in the Asian countries from
        which this gold and treasure was originally stolen, in effect a
        repatriation.
        <br />
        <br />
        Few realize the sheer magnitude of gold, diamonds, art, and other
        treasure amassed over thousands of years ruthlessly looted from China,
        Vietnam, Thailand, Burma, Singapore, Cambodia, Laos, and other Southeast
        Asian nations occupied by the Japanese. Much of this treasure still
        remains in The Philippines buried underground in engineered tunnels or
        sitting at the bottom of the sea in scuttled ships. Finding even a small
        portion of this plundered wealth can have an enormous impact in helping
        humanity and protecting our planet.
        <br />
        <br />
        Dr. McDougald and John Casey have specific plans to launch programs to
        help the people of the Philippines with their share of the bounty. As a
        life long environmentalist, I want to continue my work to stop the
        slaughter of dolphins in Japan, put an end to cetacean captivity,
        promote energy efficiency and carbon emission reduction, and rid our
        oceans of plastic and ghost nets, the discarded fishing nets threatening
        our marine ecosystem.

        I’m one of the most qualified people in the world to tell this story as
        I’ve worked in both the filmmaking and treasure hunting worlds for
        almost 30 years and my camerawork, FLIR thermal imaging techniques,
        covert filming experience, production expertise, and expedition planning
        made the Academy Award-winning documentary THE COVE, the impactful real
        life eco-thriller that it is. I intend to bring the same cinematic
        creativity and field expediency I utilized in THE COVE to our KENSU MARU
        documentary. With that in mind I’ve chosen John Mans as our Director of
        Photography. His expertise shooting in challenging maritime environments
        and working in extreme and often dangerous situations combined with his
        talent as a visual artist make him the perfect choice.
        <br />
        <br />
        In spite of the fact that the expedition has top level access to the
        halls of power in the Philippines due to Dr. McDougald’s friendships and
        connections with the highest levels of the Philippine government,
        treasure hunting in that part of the world can be unpredictable and
        possibly dangerous. Although we’ll have professional security as part of
        the crew during the expedition our greatest protection will be our
        cameras that will be documenting everything as it happens.
        <br />
        <br />
        To launch the Kensu Maru project I’ve drawn on friendships and
        connections to assemble an exceptionally talented team. Many of us have
        worked together before on multiple award-winning documentaries.
        <br />
        <br />
        With the combined skill set of our filmmaking crew and the level of
        professional expertise of our technicians and researchers we fully
        expect not just a successful expedition but a successful film. It will
        be an unpredictable and exciting adventure through which we’ll find
        answers to mysteries, explore exotic locations, meet compelling
        characters, and gain insights into human behavior. Isn’t that what a
        good movie should be?

        I first became aware of Charles Hambleton when I saw the Oscar-winning
        documentary, THE COVE. The narrator described him as an “adrenaline
        junkie with a heart of gold and nerves of steel.” The film introduced
        him standing 101 stories above Taipei on the spire that tops what was
        then the tallest building in the world. I was impressed.
        <br />
        <br />I was even more impressed when I met him in person a few years
        later to learn he was described accurately. I’ve had the pleasure of
        working with Charles on two films prior to this. When he contacted me to
        join him on the Kensu Maru project I jumped at the chance. Treasure hunt
        in the Philippines to recover billions in stolen gold from a sunken WWII
        Japanese ship? He had me at “Treasure Hunt.” He said it would be
        possibly lucrative, possibly dangerous. It sounded even better. It would
        be a great adventure. But as I did my research I realized it would also
        be a great story.
        <br />
        <br />

        The KENSU MARU documentary has a compelling protagonist in pursuit of a
        high stakes goal striving against formidable obstacles in a race against
        the clock. Chuck McDougald is an exceptional main character. There’s a
        reason he’s been so often referred to as a “real life Indiana Jones”.
        This warrior poet has led a life full of both adventure and academia.
        Although he was trained as an elite soldier it was his pen not his sword
        that helped bring down a dictator.
        <br />
        <br />
        He’s motivated not by the opportunity to gain a fortune, he’s motivated
        by the need to solve a mystery and seek justice. At 80-years-old he may
        not have much time to do it. He’s a former Green Beret on what might be
        his last and most important mission.
        <br />
        <br />
        Another of our characters, John Casey, is also extremely compelling. A
        seasoned and successful professional treasure hunter in his prime
        motivated by the thrill of the chase. He’s just as comfortable deeply
        discussing philosophy as he is digging deeply into the side of a
        mountain.
        <br />
        <br />
        But there’s another motivation for both of these men that elevates this
        from a simple treasure hunt. They both have plans to use the treasure as
        a force for good. There are several environmental and humanitarian
        initiatives that will be funded by the treasure when found. Most of the
        films I’ve worked on in the past had as their goal to try and make the
        world a better place by raising awareness of global problems and
        promoting ways to solve them. This film is no exception.
        <br />
        <br />
        The KENSU MARU documentary will have a wide audience. It’s a hybrid of
        several genres. It’s an adventure story, a mystery story, a war story, a
        history story, a character portrait, a thriller, and ultimately an
        environmental activism story. Television is filled with successful and
        popular treasure hunt series. In fact, John Casey is one of the stars of
        such a show, LOST GOLD OF WWII, a highly rated series on The History
        Channel that also focuses on the search for Yamashita’s Gold in the
        Philippines. But there is an audience beyond that demographic.
        <br />
        <br />
        The television versions of treasure hunts tell the story using the
        tropes of Reality TV. I see the KENSU MARU documentary told more in the
        style of a Sundance/Cannes caliber film. It will have all the fun and
        suspense that make treasure hunting stories so appealing but it will
        have much more. The treasure hunt story is a trojan horse to touch on
        universal themes like ambition, greed, mortality, redemption and
        justice.
        <br />
        <br />
        It’s a simple story with complex subplots. On one level, it’s a hunt for
        hidden treasure. On another level its an expose of geopolitical
        skullduggery at the highest level. It reveals a web of deceit and
        corruption involving the governments of Japan, The Philippines and the
        United States.
        <br />
        <br />
        The film will be told in a mix of styles. The present day treasure hunt
        expedition will be told in verité style as shot by our expert
        cinematographers. Much of the rest of the film will be a “clip show” of
        archival footage of WWII history, the Marcos regime, and the Vietnam
        era. I’m very happy again to be collaborating with Pamela Green of Pic
        Agency and her new archival specialty shop LEGWORK, to create these
        archival footage segments in original and innovative ways. My film
        BHUTTO won an IDA award for best use of archival material with work we
        created together.
        <br />
        <br />
        The history that KENSU MARU will be telling in this story will have
        relevance to what is happening today. Part of the KENSU MARU documentary
        is a cautionary tale of how in a few short years a democracy can
        transform into an autocracy. Ferdinand Marcos was a democratically
        elected official who became a dictator through bribery, brutality and
        repression. Our experience with the fragility of our own democracy makes
        the Marcos story particularly timely.
        <br />
        <br />
        How will the story end? We don’t know, and that’s part of the appeal.
        Dr. McDougald and the expedition crew are confident they will find a
        treasure of historic proportions. I’m confident that whether we find the
        gold or not, we’ll have found a treasure of a different sort. A great
        story.
