        <h3>Charles Hambleton</h3>
        <h4>Producer / Director</h4>
        <p>
          Charles is a filmmaker, explorer, sailor, diver, and pilot with
          experience on both narrative feature films and documentaries. He was a
          producer on the documentaries THE BIG FIX and VANISHING SAIL and has
          worked as a Sail Master, Boat Captain, and Marine Department Crew on
          four Pirates of the Caribbean franchise movies. Most recently he was a
          Boat Captain on Tom Cruise’s upcoming action feature Top Gun:
          Maverick.
          <br />
          <br />
          Charles was a Cinematographer, Producer, Sound Man, the Aerial
          Coordinator, Thermographer, and Director of Clandestine Operations for
          the Academy Award-winning documentary, The Cove. He filmed the
          majority of the verité footage in the movie and conceived many of the
          film’s most impactful scenes. He conceived the idea to use thermal
          imaging and to use cameras hidden in fake rocks to film inside the
          actual “killing cove”. He secretly penetrated the killing cove 18
          times to capture the movie’s shocking slaughter scene. He also filmed
          the award-winning underwater “Blood Cam” footage.
          <br />
          <br />
          For the documentary Racing Extinction, he covertly filmed illegal
          wildlife wet markets, illegal shark fin trade, and Whale Shark
          smuggling operations in China and South Korea. The film featured his
          footage from his endangered species whale meat sting operation at the
          trendy Santa Monica sushi restaurant, The Hump. Charles also conceived
          the idea to use a modified FLIR C02 camera to capture that film’s
          startling footage that visualized Carbon Dioxide emissions for the
          first time. He also planned and orchestrated another successful
          endangered species whale meat sting in Seoul, South Korea in
          conjunction with Korea Federation for Environmental Movements and the
          Seoul Police.
          <br />
          <br />
          Charles was a team member on several underwater treasure hunting
          expeditions in Bermuda, the Caribbean, and Venezuela, where he
          co-discovered the French Fleet of 1678 in Islas Las Aves. He has
          experience with Edgetech and Imagenex Side Scan Sonar and has used his
          skills to survey Chewamogon Bay, Lake Superior, mapping submerged old
          growth logs to be salvaged as rare and valuable timber used for high
          quality furniture and musical instruments owned by such luminaries as
          Johnny Cash and The Eagles.
          <br />
          <br />
          Charles has a long history of environmentalism starting with building
          a solar panel in 8th grade. He is an energy efficiency and ocean
          advocate and a dedicated dolphin and whale activist. He is currently
          an advisor at Ocean Voyages Institute which successfully recovered
          over 170 tons of ghost nets and ocean plastic on it’s 2020 Pacific
          Gyre Expedition using proprietary GPS trackers and a sailing cargo
          ship which is the largest open ocean cleanup in history. In a former
          life Charles was a musician and co-founded the major recording label
          and touring band “The Samples” and was co-founder of The Fox Theatre
          in Boulder, Colorado.

        <h3>Expedition Psychic</h3>
        <h4>TBD</h4>
        <p>
          The use of psychics is not uncommon in the treasure world. Treasure
          hunter Mel Fisher consulted a psychic in his search for the Atocha.
          Ferdinand Marcos consulted a psychic in his search for Yamashita’s
          gold. In fact they were the same person, the late Swedish born Olof
          Jonsson. Dr. McDougald has had encounters with Olof and was convinced
          of the authenticity of his psychic abilities. The Kensu Maru
          Expedition will also have a psychic as part of the team. It is another
          tool in our search and could provide some entertainment value. We have
          not found our own psychic yet but if they really are clairvoyant they
          should be anticipating our call.
