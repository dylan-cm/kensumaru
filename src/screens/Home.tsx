        <b>KENSU MARU</b> is a feature-length documentary that tells the story
        of “real-life Indiana Jones,” Dr. Chuck McDougald PhD, former Green
        Beret Captain, author, academic, and treasure hunter, as he journeys to
        the Philippines with a dream team of experts and cutting-edge technology
        in a quest to locate a sunken WW2 Japanese hospital ship laden with
        billions in treasure.

      <p className="paragraph">
        In 1988 while studying for his doctorate in Manilla he was tasked by the
        Aquino government to recover part of the vast fortune of looted gold
        hidden by the Japanese known as{" "}
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamashita%27s_gold">
          “Yamashita’s treasure,”
        </a>{" "}
        and to uncover the truth about its connection to the billions stolen by
        the kleptocratic dictator, Ferdinand Marcos. When a Japanese booby-trap
        killed two of his men McDougald was forced to cease the dig and flee the
        country.

        33 years later, at 80-years-old, and now possessing newly discovered
        information gleaned from decades of research, eyewitness accounts and
        recently deciphered maps, he returns to the Philippines for one last
        chance to retrieve the sunken gold to use for philanthropic endeavors
        and to seek justice for the Filipino people.
