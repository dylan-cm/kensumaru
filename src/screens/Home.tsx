            <b>KENSU MARU</b> is a feature-length documentary that tells the
            story of “real-life Indiana Jones,” Dr. Chuck McDougald PhD, former
            Green Beret Captain, author, academic, and treasure hunter, as he
            journeys to the Philippines with a dream team of experts and
            cutting-edge technology in a quest to locate a sunken WW2 Japanese
            hospital ship laden with billions in treasure.
            <br />
            <br />
            In 1988 while studying for his doctorate in Manilla he was tasked by
            the Aquino government to recover part of the vast fortune of looted
            gold hidden by the Japanese known as{" "}
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamashita%27s_gold">
              “Yamashita’s treasure,”
            </a>{" "}
            and to uncover the truth about its connection to the billions stolen
            by the kleptocratic dictator, Ferdinand Marcos. When a Japanese
            booby-trap killed two of his men McDougald was forced to cease the
            dig and flee the country.
            <br />
            <br />
            33 years later, at 80-years-old, and now possessing newly discovered
            information gleaned from decades of research, eyewitness accounts
            and recently deciphered maps, he returns to the Philippines for one
            last chance to retrieve the sunken gold to use for philanthropic
            endeavors and to seek justice for the Filipino people.
