        <h3>Riptide Autonomous Solutions UUV</h3>
        <p>
          The most powerful technology our expedition will be deploying to
          confirm the location of the Kensu Maru is our cutting edge Riptide UUV
          (Unmanned Underwater Vehicle) Commercial and military uses for the
          Riptide UUV and sensor packages include seabed surveillance, oil & gas
          survey, mine countermeasures, oceanographic data collection, and of
          course treasure hunting.
          <br />
          <br />
          Riptide UUVs have multiple side scan sonar options, as well as
          cameras, acoustic communications, and oceanographic sensors. Riptide’s
          cutting edge Synthetic Aperture System (SAS) technology offers almost
          2-inch resolution. Operating the Riptide will be Jeff Smith, the
          inventor and founder of Riptide Autonomous Solutions. Assisting him
          surveying will be Eric Brager, considered one of the best sonar and
          ROV technicians and pilots in the world.
        </p>
        <h3>VIDEORAY Pro 4 ROV</h3>
        <p>
          The Kensu Maru Expedition will deploy a VideoRay Pro 4 remotely
          operated vehicle to capture 4K video at the shipwreck site after sonar
          confirmation. The lightweight Pro 4 incorporates the latest in small
          ROV design and technology making it the most advanced, capable, and
          versatile small ROV on the market today. The Pro 4 advanced features
          include 3D tilt compensated compass, an Accelerometer, MEMS Gyro, a
          leak alarm, internal temperature gauge, real time volt meter, and
          depth sensor. It’s 300m operating depth makes its depth capabilities
          well beyond our immediate needs. Our film crew will modify the camera
          package to capture high quality footage consistent with our above
          surface cinematography.
        </p>
        <h3>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Satellite Imaging</h3>
        <p>
          After confirming the location of the Kensu Maru with sonar and video,
          John Casey will use his company, Geoscan, to pinpoint the exact
          location of the gold on our 300ft ship using a Nuclear Magnetic
          Resonance mineral identification scan from a satellite in orbit. This
          method of utilizing nuclear magnetic resonance as an effective method
          of mineral exploration and prospecting has passed numerous stringent
          practical tests since 1998 with success on both land and seafloor
          targets. Applications include archeology, geophysics, geology, and
          hydrology. John and Geoscan have a 97% success rate on targets
          confirmed with satellites including oil & gas, ore deposits, tunnels,
          voids, caves, water, precious and industrial gems. And most
          importantly to the expedition, buried treasure and shipwrecks.
          <br />
          <br />
          The satellite scan can accurately differentiate between specific
          metals and materials - like a store of gold on a steel ship. Satellite
          scans can identify and authenticate targets below the surface of the
          water to depths of over 20,000ft. This innovative technology gives us
          the information required to prove the gold’s existence, the amount of
          gold onboard, and the specific cargo hold location. This tool also
          gives us the information required to evaluate salvage strategies and
          estimate costs, potentially saving years of investigation with divers
          and ROVs.

        <h3>The John A.B. Dillard</h3>
        <p>
          The Kensu Maru Expedition and film crew will be using the US Army
          Corps of Engineers vessel John A.B.Dillard, as a support vessel while
          conducting a sonar test survey on San Francisco Bay of the shipwreck
          SS City of Chester that sank in 217ft of water in 1888 just inside the
          Golden Gate Bridge. The size of the sunken ship and the depth at which
          it rests is similar to the Kensu Maru. The team will be testing the
          smaller of their Riptide Autonomous Solutions UUVs equipped with a
          state of the art Kraken Synthetic Aperture System (SAS) sonar. This
          camera and sonar test will minimize unexpected variables in the
          Philippines.
        </p>
        <h3>Pentarius Submarine</h3>
        <p>
          The team will deploy the DeepFlight Super Falcon sub PENTARIUS to film
          the wreck of the Kensu Maru and investigate several other promising
          sites on our treasure maps. This James Bond style submarine is capable
          of undersea “flying” to about 330 feet and is a uniquely spectacular
          filming platform. One of its biggest differences from the current crop
          of small personal submersibles is its range. Where others can barely
          drift about, essentially limited to a vertical descent and ascent,
          Pentarius can “fly” over 6 miles of ocean floor on a single mission.
          The Pentarius not only provides a necessary part of our treasure
          hunting technology it adds a serious wow factor to the film. There is
          something seriously cinematic and cool about an 80 yr-old former Green
          Beret flying laps around a 300ft sunken WWII hospital ship loaded with
          half a billion dollars in treasure.
        </p>
        <h3>Catamaran Cheyenne</h3>
        <p>
          The Pentarius sub’s mothership is the 130’ CHEYENNE, which in a
          previous life was adventurer Steve Fossett’s ocean racing Maxi Cat,
          “Playstation”. Along with submarine deployment, Cheyenne will serve as
          a survey platform and is capable of towing an auxiliary multi-beam
          sonar rig. Additionally, due to the location of our site, keeping a
          low profile is not really an option for a crew of western explorers &
          filmmakers so the Cheyenne will serve as an effective 130ft
          “billboard” and can be wrapped with any messaging or sponsorship we
          desire. In 2019 the Cheyenne assisted Ocean Voyages Institute’s ocean
          plastic cleanup initiative tagging ghost nets with GPS satellite tags
          in the Pacific Plastic Gyre. The Cheyenne and Pentarius are currently
          moored in Okinawa after Covid-19 interrupted its previous mission of
          searching for WWII ordinance with chemical sniffing UUVs. The
          Pentarius’ backstory of WWII ordinance detecting and ocean cleanup
          missions fits nicely with some of our film’s WWII military history and
          environmental initiatives.
