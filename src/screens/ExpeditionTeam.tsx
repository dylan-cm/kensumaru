        <h3>Dr. Chuck Mcdougald PhD</h3>
        <h4>Expedition Leader</h4>
        <p>
          DR. CHUCK McDOUGALD PhD has lived a life of adventure and
          accomplishment. He’s been described in the press as a “real life
          Indiana Jones” and is the author of three books,The Marcos File, Asian
          Loot - Unearthing the secrets of Marcos, Yamashita, AND the Gold, and
          The Buddha, The Gold, and The Myth.
          <br />
          <br />
          His academic credentials include a Bachelor of Science Degree from the
          University of Georgia, a Masters Degree from the Asian Institute of
          Management, and a Doctorate in business from the University of the
          Philippines. He’s a licensed pilot with a 4th degree black belt in
          both Shoto-kan and Seigo-kan karate and has an IQ of 163.
          <br />
          <br />
          Born and raised in small town Georgia, the son of a railroad engineer,
          he joined the US Army in 1964 and after his promotion to Fist
          Lieutenant, a requirement for special forces, served for over five
          years in the special forces as a Green Beret Captain. He volunteered
          for service in Vietnam and was assigned as security for an Australian
          medical unit where he served out of uniform in civilian clothes. He
          had a top secret security clearance and some of his missions remain
          classified to this day.
          <br />
          <br />
          After his tour in Vietnam he commanded the 156th Medical Detachment
          where he trained Special Forces medics on Okinawa and , as a master
          parachutist, he performed HALO (High Altitude Low Opening) jumps
          exiting the plane from 25,000 feet, free falling at 190 miles an hour,
          and only opening his shoot at 4,000 feet. He then took six two man
          medical teams to the Thai- Laotian border, again out of uniform and in
          civilian clothes. His first duty on arrival was to approve an order of
          the CIA’s Phoenix Program that planned assassinations of political
          enemies in Vietnam. After he left the service he accepted a job as
          country manager of Piedmont International and returned to Vietnam in
          1969 as a civilian to sell mutual funds to American soldiers and
          civilians living in what was still an active war zone. After winning
          Salesman of the Year he moved from Saigon to Hong Kong where he
          managed several businesses. In 1972 he moved to the Philippines where
          he launched a successful business importing whiskey from Scotland. It
          was the same year Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law. McDougald
          started to keep a file to document the vast corruption of the Marcos
          regime.
          <br />
          <br />
          He sold his business and went back to school on the GI bill. While
          studying for his masters and doctorate degrees he met many influential
          people from the military, business, and government as either
          classmates or teachers. As the economy deteriorated and social
          repression increased, there were daily demonstrations against the
          brutal dictator. Marcos declared a snap election to prove he still had
          the mandate of the people and was opposed by Corazon Aquino, wife of
          assassinated opposition leader Ninoy Aquino.
          <br />
          <br />
          The file McDougald had started on Marcos, now a completed book, was
          making the rounds of publishers. The first chapter exposed the
          fraudulent claims of Marcos’ heroic wartime record and bogus medals.
          The manuscript was noticed by an anti-Marcos journalist who realized
          it could help the Aquino campaign. Part of it was published in a
          popular magazine and the million copies printed all sold out within
          days.
          <br />
          <br />
          Marcos was declared the winner of the election but the election was
          proven to be fraudulent. Thus began a sequence of events that led to
          the People Power Revolution that deposed Marcos and forced him to flee
          the country. Chuck’s exposé was a significant factor in helping to
          overthrow the brutal dictator.
          <br />
          <br />
          Many of Chuck’s friends from the academic world now had positions of
          power and influence in the new Aquino administration. Among them, his
          former teacher Dr. Noel Soriano, who had been appointed National
          Security Director. As part of a group assigned to track down the
          hidden wealth of Marcos, Soriano was tasked to investigate the stories
          of treasure hunts conducted by Marcos’ military to retrieve the
          legendary Yamashita’s treasure, thought to be billions in looted gold
          hidden by the Japanese in the Philippines. He also suspected that
          Marcos had hidden some of the billions in gold he stole from the
          Filipino people in some of the buried sites.
          <br />
          <br />
          Soriano gave Dr. McDougald access to original Japanese maps and
          trusted him to lead the mission to investigate several treasure sites.
          His unique skill set as a former Green Beret Captain combined with his
          academic background and personal integrity made him the right man for
          the job. With President Aquino’s approval, McDougald clandestinely
          conducted two treasure hunts, one on Corregidor Island and one at Fort
          Santiago. When a booby-trap cave-in killed two of his men just days
          away from learning the truth his top-secret operation made the front
          page of almost every major newspaper in the world and he had to stop
          the dig. His book, ASIAN LOOT, is based on these exploits. Today Dr.
          McDougald lives in San Francisco where he and his Philippine-born
          wife, Charito have raised two children. He continues to pursue the
          mystery of the hidden gold. After many years of research and equipped
          with newly deciphered maps, he believes he now knows the answer.
